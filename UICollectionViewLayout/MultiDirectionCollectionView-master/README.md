# MultiDirectionCollectionView-Starter

*Starter Project for Credera.com Blog @ https://www.credera.com/blog/mobile-applications-and-web/building-a-multi-directional-uicollectionview-in-swift/*

## What is this?

This is a template project intended for use when following along with the *-TODO-BLOG_NAME-* on Credera.com at [Building a Multi-Directional UICollectionView in Swift](https://www.credera.com/blog/mobile-applications-and-web/building-a-multi-directional-uicollectionview-in-swift/). If you would prefer to create the project from scratch, step by step instructions for building the start project are provided below. 

## Starting From Scratch

1. Open Xcode
2. Select File → New → Project
3. Select Single View Application under iOS → Application

4. Fill out the fields as shown below. Note, the Product Name and Bundle Identifier do not have to match ours.

5. Select a location to save your project
6. Delete ViewController.swift *(It won't be used)*
7. Open Main.storyboard and delete all items in the storyboard to start with a clean slate
8. Drag a `Collection View Controller` from Object Library in the bottom right corner

9. Select the CollectionViewController you just placed on the storyboard and check the "Is Initial View Controller checkbox inside the Attributes Inspector tab.

10. Run the project!

At this point, you should simply see a black screen similar to the screenshot below. This a what a default Collection View Controller looks like without any data source or delegates configured. An empty black screen, fascinating, eh? Pick up where you left off over at [*-TODO-BLOG_LINK-*](*-TODO-BLOG_LINK-*).
