/**
 The CollectionViewDelegateSlantedLayout protocol defines methods that let you coordinate with a
 CollectionViewSlantedLayout object to implement a slanted layout.
 The methods of this protocol define the size of items.
*/

    // MARK: Getting the Size of Items

    /**
     Asks the delegate for the size of the specified item’s cell.
     
     If you do not implement this method, the slanted layout uses the values in its itemSize property
     to set the size of items instead. Your implementation of this method can return a fixed set of
     sizes or dynamically adjust the sizes based on the cell’s content.
     
     - Parameters:
        - collectionView: The collection view object displaying the slanted layout.
        - collectionViewLayout: The layout object requesting the information.
        - indexPath: The index path of the item.
     - Returns: The height of the specified item (or it's width for vertical scrolling direction). The value must be greater than 0.
