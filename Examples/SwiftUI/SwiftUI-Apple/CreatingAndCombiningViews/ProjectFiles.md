# Project Files: Creating and Combining Views

To follow the [Creating and Combining Views](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views) tutorial, you'll create a new Xcode project as described in the first section of the tutorial. When prompted by the tutorial, you'll need the image in the **Resources** folder. To explore on your own, open the Xcode project in the **Complete** folder and browse the project's code.

- Note: To preview and interact with views from the canvas in Xcode ensure your Mac is running macOS 10.15 or later.
