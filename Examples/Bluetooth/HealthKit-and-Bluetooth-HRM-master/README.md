# A Simple Core Bluetooth demo

*Developed by Andrew Jaffee*

As iOS developers, we’re very aware that humans love connectivity. Obviously, we love to communicate with each other using wireless devices. More recently, we’ve come expect that we can communicate with what once were considered standalone, ordinary devices. We’ve come to love, even expect, that some of those wireless devices can gather and analyze data about ourselves (usually “wearables”). So many devices have become intrinsic parts of our lives that we’ve coined a now commonly-used phrase, the “Internet of Things” or “IoT.” There are now billions of wireless, communicable devices on the planet. In this tutorial, we’re going to focus on just one segment of the IoT: Bluetooth®.

I’ll explain the essential concepts behind Bluetooth® technology, plus:

* Show you how getting proficient in Bluetooth® software development presents you with a tremendous career opportunity
* Remind you that you can’t distribute an app that uses Bluetooth® without determining if you need to go through “qualification”
* Provide you with an overview of Apple’s Core Bluetooth framework (see also here)
* Finally, walk you through the development of an iOS app in Swift 4 that monitors a person’s heart rate via Core Bluetooth via a Bluetooth® device.
